# FPKGi - A Server-Based PS4 & PS5 Content Installer
> [!NOTE]
> FPKGi (Fake PKG Installer) is an open-source homebrew app for installing modified .pkg files on the PS4 and PS5. Inspired by the original PKGi for PSP, Vita, and PS3, it enables you to manage and install content via .json files—from your device, a local network, or the web—and supports package downloads from your private server. Designed for educational and personal use, FPKGi promotes game preservation in the PlayStation homebrew scene by streamlining content browsing, downloading, and installation. For best performance, offload your files to a NAS and run a web server with Node.js or Python, then pass the content URL to your .json files.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Use FPKGi responsibly and in accordance with the laws of your country. This tool is intended solely for legal, educational, and personal use. Do not use FPKGi for piracy or any other illegal activities. Always download FPKGi from our official GitHub repository, via pkg-zone.com, or through the Homebrew Store, and avoid third-party sources. We assume no responsibility to any damage from malicious downloads and/or legal issues.

## Setup Instructions
#### Download the Latest Version:
   - Get the latest compiled package from the [Releases](https://github.com/ItsJokerZz/FPKGi/releases) or visit [pkg-zone.com](https://pkg-zone.com/details/FPKGI13337).

#### Install the Package:
   - Choose your preferred method to install the package on your console.
   - Alternatively, you can install directly from LightningMods' [Homebrew Store](https://github.com/LightningMods/PS4-Store).

### GitHub Build Automation
This repository now includes a GitHub Actions workflow that attempts to build `source/build/FPKGi_v2.0.0_PS4.pkg` on every push to `main` and uploads it as a workflow artifact.

> The workflow runs in `windows-latest` and uses `source/create_pkg_builder.py` to generate the package.

### Building Locally
To build the PS4 PKG locally, you need:
1. **Unity with PS4 Support**: Install Unity 2019+ with PS4 build module (requires Sony PS4 SDK).
2. **PS4 SDK**: Obtain and install the official Sony PS4 SDK.
3. **Packaging Tools**: Install `orbis-pub-cmd.exe` (from PS4 SDK) or `ps4-pkg-tool.exe` (open-source alternative from https://github.com/pearlxcore/ps4-pkg-tool).
4. **Python 3**: For running the build scripts.

#### Steps:
1. Open the project in Unity with PS4 support.
2. Build for PS4 target, which will create `eboot.bin` in `Builds/PS4/app/`.
3. Run `python source/create_pkg_builder.py` to create the PKG.

If packaging tools are not available, the build will fail. Ensure you have valid PS4 development tools installed.

> [!NOTE]
> For modified/jailbroken PS4, unsigned PKGs created with open-source tools are acceptable. The CE-34706-0 error occurs when the PKG is corrupted or improperly formatted.

### Populate Content
Launch the app to automatically create the necessary directories and `.json` files in the `/user/data/FPKGi/` folder.

#### Populate Content Locally
Edit the `.json` files generated at `/user/data/FPKGi/ContentJSONs/` to add your content. <br>
**You can also generate / populate, and save the necessary `.json` file [here](https://www.itsjokerzz.site/projects/FPKGi/gen/) on my site.**

> [!NOTE]
> Use bytes for `"size"` and for specifying content's region: `"USA"`, `"JAP"`, `"EUR"`, `"ASIA"`, or `null`.

### Example `.json` structure:
```json
{
    "DATA": {
        "https://www.example.com/directLinkToContent.pkg": {
            "region": "USA",
            "name": "Content Title",
            "version": "1.00",
            "release": "11-15-2014",
            "size": 1000000000,
            "min_fw": null,
            "cover_url": "https://www.example.com/cover.png"
        }
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please ensure the size is as accurate as possible to prevent issues with downloading! The following fields can be <br> left as `null`
where applicable: `"version"`, `"region"`, `"release"`, `"min_fw"`, and `"cover_url"` if you decide.

#### Populate Content Via Web
To enable web population, edit the `config.json` file located at `/user/data/FPKGi/` and enable it in the menu.

### Locate and edit the following section:
```json
    "CONTENT_URLS": {
      "PS1": null,
      "PS2": null,
      "PSP": null,
      "games": null,
      "apps": null,
      "updates": null,
      "DLC": null,
      "demos": null,
      "homebrew": null,
      "emulators": null,
      "themes": null
    }
```

#### Replace `null` with URLs pointing to `.json` files containing your content:
```json
    "CONTENT_URLS": {
      "games": "https://www.example.com/GAMES.json"
    }
```

Unspecified fields will default to loading content from local `.json` files.
